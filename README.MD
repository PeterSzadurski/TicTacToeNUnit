## Purpose

I needed to make a simple project for learning unit testing (NUnit). For this, I decided to make a Tic-Tac-Toe console app. Something very easy to code, but were unit testing might be helpful.


## Running The Program
Open **Solution.sln**.  
The **TicTacToeLogic** portion just contains methods and classes, so either run the unit tests to verify that the logic works or **TicTacConsole** to play the game.
